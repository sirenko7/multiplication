Multiplication of two large numbers. 
Can be done using algorithm from scratch or BigInteger class implementation. 
Runs from command line or IDE's console.

Execute from jar with the command containing arguments for algorithm and both numbers.
Example: "java -jar multiplication.jar alg1 20409034209492049020349 51651654949898949849898949494998"

You can uncomment a block of code in the main() method to use IDE's console.
