Multiplication of two large numbers. 
Can be done using algorithm from scratch or BigInteger class implementation. 
Runs from command line or IDE's console.

To run jar you need to pass 3 arguments: 
1. "alg1" - BigInteger implementation or "alg2" - custom implementation.
2. First number
3. Second number

Example: "java -jar multiplication.jar alg1 20409034209492049020349 51651654949898949849898949494998"

You can uncomment a block of code in the main() method to use IDE's console.
